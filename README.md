[Sneakerboss](https://sneakerboss-rebe94.koyeb.app/) project was created in order to help my friends in monitoring products from [StockX](https://stockx.com/) market.

â€‹	The web application allows to search streetwear products with its current market price and also monitor them. The application are built on `modular architecture` with entrypoint for every module which is `Facade design pattern`. The application is covered by BDD tests to provide the system working assurance.
Under the hood sneakerboss app calls `StockX API` and official `polish central bank NBP API` to get exchange currency rate.   
The application is available 24/7 thanks to `Koyeb web hosting`, it was deployed via `Docker file` configuration.
The project is being constantly developed.
